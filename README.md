# Paris Route Finder

The Paris Route Finder is an application that uses a GUI to create routes between two landmarks chosen in the choice box, using nodes initialised in a graph 
It supports various functionalities for pathfinding and distance calculations. The class includes methods for finding all possible paths between nodes using depth-first search (DFS), calculating distances between nodes based on their coordinates, and finding the shortest path using both Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm and breadth-first search (BFS). The application uses these algorithms to efficiently navigate and analyze routes within the graph, providing valuable insights into path costs and shortest routes between landmarks. The app also prints the most historical route using Dijkstra's algorithm using stringbuilder into an alert/popup once the button is pressed.
